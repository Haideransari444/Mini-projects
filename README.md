In this Python script, we begin by importing necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. We then load a CSV file containing data into a pandas DataFrame. The info method is used to display information about the DataFrame's structure, including data types and non-null values. Next, we handle missing data by filling NaN values and replacing specific unwanted values (e.g., empty strings, -999, 'NA', and NaN) with an empty string. We also set the first row as the header and reset the DataFrame index to maintain consistency. To prepare for visualization, we concatenate 'First name' and 'Last name' columns to create a 'full name' column, ensuring there are no missing values in these columns. Finally, we extract data for plotting, configure the plotâ€™s appearance, and use a scatter plot to visualize the data, where each point is color-coded for distinctio
